# dBox
dBox is a lightweight container runtime implemented in Go that demonstrates containerization principles. It utilizes UTS, PID, and filesystem namespaces to create isolated environments for executing commands. This project serves as a hands-on exploration of low-level Linux system calls and core container functionalities.
